NAME=Round 11 - Monza 10/20/13
DESCRIPTION=Monza is called the Temple of Speed for a reason. If the corners don't seem particularly hard to tackle, it's because you are breaking too early. The sausage kerbs are there specifically for you to not run into them: here it's always better to sacrifice cornering speed to get a clean exit. It's quite misty today, but you should have enough visibility to chase other cars' slipstreams.<br><br>Again, if you don't struggle enough going through the Ascari, something is wrong. Lower your downforce and make sure to let the diffuser do its work by lowering the car down.<br><br>Tyre wear and temperature would be likely unbalanced, but you won't struggle for grip that much either. The car will be pretty thirsty during the race.

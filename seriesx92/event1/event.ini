DESCRIPTION=CLASS LEADERBOARD:<br>1st: 2:44.414<br>Median: 2:47.248<br>75%: 2:51.254<br><br>We are so excited for your first run! Make sure you treat Mila as she deserves.<br><br>You can do two recon laps, but I'm going to give you some general advice to make sure you'll learn faster.<br>First of all Mila is not very thirsty, so you can really save weight on fuel.<br>You'll hardly need longer gear ratios, acceleration will be the key to keep momentum.<br>Lastly, you can really exploit weight transfer to gain a degree of lateral grip you wouldn't expect from this type of car.<br><br>As for the track, Kotor has long straights that are even more evident when you don't have much power: most of the time you will be pedal to the metal. For this reason, lowering ride height will make you gain lots of time. Slamming the car may require stiffer springs, making the car more nervous and increasing the risk of error. You can mitigate this by tweaking the dampers on the second run and check the difference. Keep an eye on the tires, so we can set the ideal pressure for the power lap. Also, don't get distracted by the beautiful landscape!

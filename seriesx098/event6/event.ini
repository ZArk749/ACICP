NAME=Setup: tricky track
DESCRIPTION=Today we are at Magione, a small track in the heart of Italy. Definetely too small for your power: a perfect occasion to tweak your gearing. The tire workflow is the same, but you can also play with suspension to deal with the bumpy tarmac, even though you won't fully neutralize the car's shaking. Try to tweak the front splitter as well: it may help you with laptimes at the cost of having a more nervous car.<br><br>Leo's tip:<br>The first thing to do should be gearing. Don't waste your time practicing with the wrong gearing, especially in a track in which you need to keep half-throttle a lot.<br><br>OBJECTIVES:<br>Gold: 1:12.500<br>Silver: 1:13.000<br>Bronze: 1:14.000

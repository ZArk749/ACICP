[EVENT]
NAME=Advanced: lightweight mid-engine
DESCRIPTION=We raise the difficulty again by hopping in a KTM X-BOW, closing in into racecar territory. The X-BOW is a lightweight track-toy but more importantly is mid-engined, meaning very agile but harder to control when grip is lost. You will sustain your final exam in this car, but first you need to learn what to expect from a similar vehicle.<br><br>Leo's tip:<br>The car's suspensions are harder compared to what you have driven before, watch out for high kerbs. In fact, you must be quite precise: mid-rear cars spin easier than they make you might think.<br><br>OBJECTIVES:<br>Gold: 1:35.500<br>Silver: 1:36.500<br>Bronze: 1:37.500

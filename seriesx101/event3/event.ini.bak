[EVENT]
NAME=Basics: high speed cornering
DESCRIPTION=In this test we completely skip turn 1 and 2 to test you out on a sequence of fast, differently angled corners. Weight transfer was important in the last test, but now you will understand how it affects the car dynamics when you are not braking. We expect you to do faster than your last test.<br><br>Leo's tip:<br>High speed does not mean same speed. Pay attention to how much throttle you can apply for each part of the corners sequence, and keep in mind that there's still a straight afterwards.<br><br>NOTE: medal requirements are expressed in milliseconds.

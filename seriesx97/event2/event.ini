[EVENT]
NAME=Pesky director
DESCRIPTION=You've been offered to work for a photoshoot for the upcoming Octavia Cup marketing campaign. You showed up to the track, and when you understood what the director meant by "doing some skidding", you kindly explained that there's no point for a FWD car to drift, as it hardly benefits laptimes. As the director answered with "It's a Skoda, not an FWD", you gave up and started repeating in your mind the keypoints of the scandinavian flick, hoping for the best.

NAME=Borgloh
DESCRIPTION=CLASS LEADERBOARD:<br>1st: 1:15.382<br>Median: 1:16.499<br>75%: 1:17.207<br><br>We as a team are a bit concerned about what I'm going to sayâ€¦ but most of the other participants will take more risks, as there's no point for conservative driving in such a short run. Send it! Just, don't mistreat Mila, okay?<br><br>One liter of fuel should be more than enough. Tires surely won't get to temperature in time, so set ideal pressures with cold tires in mind. Slamming the car down will prove more than helpful, as the asphalt is banked and pretty smooth. Regardless, corners can be unforgiving: we strongly doubt you will be able to Colin McRae your way to the finish line. Please, please be careful with the car!

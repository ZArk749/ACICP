NAME=Setup: basics
DESCRIPTION=Now we talk for real: meet the Lotus Evora GX, the GT race car that makes no compromises to seek that go-kart feeling.<br><br>With this little weapon you will learn how to fiddle with car setup to squeeze each and every horsepower throughout different tracks in Italy. In this test we want you to acclimatize to the Evora and get a feeling on how to adjust tire pressures. If you feel brave enough, play with camber as well.<br><br>Leo's tip:<br>Fourth wall break here. In real life you are not alone: engineers tweak the car for you, often with the aid of telemetry. In thisâ€¦ reality, apps replace this role. Make sure you have the right tools to understand how to tweak your car effectively!

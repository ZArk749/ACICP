NAME=Basics: acclimatizing to high speeds
DESCRIPTION=Meet the beautiful Alfa Romeo Giulietta QV. It's a front wheel drive hot hatchback with a good amount of power, perfect to learn car dynamics safely.<br><br>In this first assignment, we ask you to drive around the oval configuration as fast as you can. This is a useful excercise in order to get to know the limits of the car without putting yourself in danger. Our target time is approximately 55 seconds.<br><br>Leo's tip:<br>Each of the four turns is different: your gas/steering combination should depend on road slope, entry speed, or if there's an upcoming straight etc. Your leftmost tires will overheat quickly. Do cooldown laps, and come in for a tyre change whenever you need to.<br><br>OBJECTIVES:<br>Gold: 0:53.500<br>Silver: 0:55.000<br>Bronze: 0:56.000
